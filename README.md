It is a simple publishing tool that enables users to submit a form to publish an article along with its title and link. Then, users can choose to upvote or downvote posts.

According to how many votes each item receives, the list of articles is presented in sorted order.

For that project, I developed an MVC structure where all the logic is housed in a class called ArticleModel that is in charge of extracting the domain name from the supplied link and up-or-down voting as well. The views are an article item as well as the parent app component. used the CSS libraries for Bootstrap and Font Awesome.
